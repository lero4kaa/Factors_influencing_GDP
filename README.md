# Influence of people's values on the GDP growth
The aim of this project is to check whether people's values have impact on the economic
growth of the country. At first I used modified version of Robert Barro's model to determine significant variables, that affected GDP growth in 2015-2019. Then variables corresponding to different people's values were added to the model. Check out more in results.pdf.
